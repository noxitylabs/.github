# Welcome to Noxity's Github! 🚀

## Who We Are 🌟

We are Noxity, the team that's about as modern as your grandma's 2019 iPhone 11 Pro! We're so fresh, we've only been around since 2019. But don't let our age fool you. 👴👵 We specialize in creating tailor-made hosting solutions that are more impressive than a cat playing the piano. 🐱🎹

**Extra Fun Fact** : We are proudly 100% privately owned "Slovenian entity."

## Commitment to The Environment 🌍

We love clean and renewable energy. In fact, we hug our solar panels goodnight. (Not really, safety first!) For every invoice we get paid, we plant a tree. 🌳 It's like a "buy one, get a tree free" kind of deal!

## Our Values 👐

Aside from being coding maestros, we're human. Well, except for the Glitch, we're not entirely sure about the Glitch. He is a great helper though! 😊

We're passionate bubble tea… I mean, passionate **about** our work. Always striving for transparency with our clients, except for our secret love of pineapple on pizza. 🍍🍕

**Honesty**, **innovation**, and **open communication** are the pillars that hold up our office. Metaphorically of course, it's actually a pretty sturdy building!

And did we mention we meet every challenge head-on? Just like how we encountered the office coffee maker that one time. We share no more about this incident. ☕️👀

So buckle up, folks! You're in for a wild, well coded rollercoaster ride. 🎢

P.S: You may notice that Glitch is currently handling some of the traffic to our old site. Cool stuff in progress! Stay tuned!
